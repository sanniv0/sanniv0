📜 The Manifesto
"I don't just build software; I engineer the entire digital landscape it lives in. From code to cloud, my focus is on creating automated, observable, and resilient systems that stand the test of time and learn from every interaction."

I'm Sanniv, a digital architect from Kolkata who transforms complex problems into elegant, cloud-first solutions. My journey in technology is driven by three core principles:

Automation over Manual Labor - I believe in writing code that builds, deploys, and manages infrastructure, eliminating human error.

Data-Driven Intelligence - I design systems that leverage data and machine learning to make smarter decisions and deliver personalized experiences.

Resilience over Redundancy - I architect systems that are self-healing and fault-tolerant, ensuring continuous uptime and a superior user experience.

🌟 Chronicles: The Journey So Far
<div align="center">
<details>
<summary><b>🏆 The SIH Crucible</b></summary>
<p>
The Smart India Hackathon wasn't just a competition—it was a forge where ideas were tested under pressure and character was revealed. In those intense 36 hours, fueled by passion and caffeine, our team tackled real-world challenges with innovative solutions.
</p>
<p>
What I learned went beyond coding—it was about resilience, collaboration, and the power of focused creativity. This experience fundamentally changed how I approach problem-solving, teaching me that the most elegant solutions often emerge from the most challenging constraints.

<h3> Reimagining User Experiences</h3>
<p>
<b>The Challenge:</b> Creating a responsive, high-performance web application that breaks conventional patterns.<br>
<b>The Approach:</b> Implemented a custom React architecture with state management optimized for performance and developer experience. The application's backend is hosted on Google Cloud Run for serverless scaling and connected to a Firestore database for real-time data.<br>
<b>The Impact:</b>
<ul>
<li>95+ Lighthouse performance score across all metrics</li>
<li>40% reduction in load time compared to industry standards through Cloud CDN integration</li>
<li>Intuitive interface that reduced user learning curve by 60%</li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3> Engineering for Scale</h3>
<p>
<b>The Challenge:</b> Building a system that could grow from hundreds to millions of users without redesign.<br>
<b>The Approach:</b> Designed a microservices architecture on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) with event-driven communication via Pub/Sub and intelligent caching using Memorystore. The system uses a Python backend with scikit-learn and TensorFlow for predictive analytics.<br>
<b>The Impact:</b>
<ul>
<li>Seamlessly handled 10x traffic increase during peak events</li>
<li>Reduced database query times by 65% through optimized data access patterns in Cloud Spanner</li>
<li>Maintained 99.9% uptime even during unexpected traffic surges through automated scaling policies in GKE</li>
</ul>
